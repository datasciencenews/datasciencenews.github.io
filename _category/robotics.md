Robotics is the design, construction and use of robots to automate procedures in the real-world.

We've included this as a topic because Data Science techniques can help us to design and program better robots, understand their behaviour in more detail, and see a practical, real-world output for our results.

Robotics requires a huge number of computer science and engineering disciplines, such as information engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and of course data science, to produce a good result.
