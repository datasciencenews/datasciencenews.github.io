Deep learning techniques have been around for many years, but the use of these techniques has expanded significantly in recent years due to the combination of:

- Vast amounts of data to train with
- Access to high performance GPUs to train much more rapidly
- Improved performance which can exceed human performance

Here's an intro to deep learning from MathWorks:
