Cloud Computing is a technology which allows companies and consumers to easily purchase and use various types of compute resources that are managed for them by other businesses and shared with other users.

This technology has been a huge benefit to Data Science as it has facilitated cost-effective access to vast compute which would have previously been financially impossible.

There are a huge number of providers of Cloud computing services, but the big three are Amazon (Amazon Web Services, AWS), Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Google Cloud Platform).

By leveraging economies of scale, these providers are able to cheaply and easily provide access to vast compute resources, such as servers, processing, memory and storage, in environments deployed around the world.

Resources are typically provided via Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS), Platform As A Service (PaaS), or Software As A Service (SaaS). IaaS allows users to access virtual services which replicate traditional datacenter hardware, such as servers, load balancers, network security and so on. PaaS allows users to access services which replicate higher level functionality; the user doesn't need to manage virtual servers directly for example, but would need to manage the platform that their app or service is running on. SaaS is the most end-user appropriate approach, where a company sells an app or service directly to consumers over the internet.
