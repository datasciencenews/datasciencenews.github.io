MathWorks are offering a Coursera course about predictive modelling and machine learning in MATLAB.

Data scientists nowadays are certainly not short of tools, and while MATLAB may not necessarily be the first choice, there are a lot of upsides if you already have access to it.

This 3-week Coursera course is possible to audit for free (no assessments) or you can pay to upgrade for assessments as well. It looks like it covers a lot of the fundamentals you might need in MATLAB and some practical examples too.
