Pediatrician Aaron E. Carroll in the New York Times discusses how the general public are approaching Coronavirus risk entirely backwards.

The risks associated with spending time in large groups due to Coronavirus are additive, which is not how a lot of people are treating it.

The common consensus is if you are a child in school, you might as well go to your friend's house too. However each instance increases the overall risk of transmission.

Removing some activities in exchange for others, rather than expecting everything to be available simultaneously, may allow a return to something like normality much faster.
