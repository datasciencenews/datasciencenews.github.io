Donald G. McNeil Jr. of the New York Times writes about writing about Coronavirus.

<!-- - -->

This is from the Times Insider series, and is designed to give a bit of background about how the NYT journalists work behind the scenes.

What's interesting about this article is that he discusses how hard it is to keep up with the latest data and facts, and how he tries to predict the most likely outcome of what will happen next.

While it's still some way off from having a model available to help with this kind of work, it's interesting how experts in their field tackle this problem at the moment.
