A programming tutorial for putting together a simulation of Boids.

<!-- - -->

Boids are a classic example of emergent behaviour and this is a neat little tutorial showing you how to get started with a boid simulation in Python.

Boids combine separation, aligning and cohesion behaviour to act like you would see a flock of birds in a 2D or 3D space.
