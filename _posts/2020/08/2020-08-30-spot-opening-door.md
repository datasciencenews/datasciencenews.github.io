Boston Dynamics' Spot robot dog working as a pair to open a door and then hold it open as they traverse it.

<!-- - -->

Boston Dynamics have been responsible for a number of terrifying, "the future is here" robots in the past few years.

If you watch really close as the robot with the arm moves, you can see the arm reacting to keep the end point in the same position and orientation. Some really neat control systems at work in here.

You can also see the adaptability of the hand effector in being able to use the handle as you would expect a human too.

Finally, some neat design as the arm is long enough and flexible enough to hold the door open behind the robot as it goes through.
